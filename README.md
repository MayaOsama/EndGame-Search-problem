# EndGame-Search-problem
The problem that we are solving is a search problem. The goal is to search for a sequence of actions where Iron Man can collect all stones, go to the cell where Thanos is standing and snap before his damage reaches 100. We solve this problem by creating a search tree with the initial state of the problem being the root. For every node the actions that Iron Man can perform represent the branches. We repeat the expansion of the nodes to branches until we find a node where Iron Man reaches his goal.
